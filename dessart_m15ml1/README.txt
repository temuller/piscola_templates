This template is a modified version of the Dessart SN IIP m15mlt1 template
taken from https://www-n.oca.eu/supernova/sn2p/ccsn_systematics.html.

The original template is linearly interpolated in time and
the phases are shifted such that the Bessell-B-band light-curve
peak is taken as phase 0 (zero).
