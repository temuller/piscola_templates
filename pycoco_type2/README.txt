This template is a modified version of the PyCoCo SN II 2013by template
taken from https://github.com/maria-vincenzi/PyCoCo_templates/tree/master/Templates_HostCorrected.

The original template is linearly interpolated in time and
the phases are shifted such that the Bessell-B-band light-curve
peak is taken as phase 0 (zero).
